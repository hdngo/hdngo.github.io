        Alright, let me just start off by saying, for those of you reading right now, this post is a DEFINITE work in progress. I apologize, because with my current time constraints, there's NO WAY I can answer the questions in the prompt for this blog post the way I want to before reaching that midnight deadline. So if you're reading this and are curious about which thoughts I chose to leave unsaid, feel free to come back to this post later!
    </p>
    <p>
        Seriously though, I'm just going to go with one of the first that immediately caught my eye from the list, otherwise I'd be stuck looking through the table for another hour. Yeah, can't run no script to pick the ones for me that easily now can I? 
    </p>
    <p>
        So what value am I writing about for the time being? 
    </p> 
    <p>
        Music.
    </p>
    <p>
        But seriously DBC, you're limiting me to only giving a 5 as the max rating for music? Mannnnn. Music is wonderful. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I regret the fact that I chose to write about music because there really is no way to put into words how valuable music is in my life. One thing I can say for sure is that music has definitely connected me to a few of the DBC'ers in the Bumblebee Cohort already, and it's definitely got me looking forward to what's to come. But another thing I can say for sure is that, I believe what I said earlier about how there really is no way to put into words how valuable music is. That's why I dance, though. Let's save that topic for a later edit though, cause I gotta wrap this one up, finish the quiz and..yeah cramming much like a typical college student right now haha.

       Advice? Well first off, why isn't advice a value!? 
       If I had to think of the "last topic" that someone asked me for advice on, I'd have to say that it was ambition. I have a lot of friends who are ambitious, or at least like to say and act like they are. But when it comes to seeing things through, most of them are highly susceptible to becoming overwhelmed by what is simply known as life. Life happens, people doubt themselves, and former ambitions and dreams can be shattered in an instant without the use of any force whatsoever, as it can be a simple word, phrase, or pair of eyes that tear down all sense of self-respect and self-esteem. But I digress. Ambition, ambition.. It's a great thing to have, but it's not so great when you're so caught up in your ambition that you forget to take care of the most important thing in the process of fulfilling it - yourself. So what's more valuable than ambition? Your health.

      Yep, that's exactly what I told my friend, who is typically stubborn in his own right, but hustles like no other when it really counts. Unfortunately, I'll have to get back to this story later, but let's just say that it's no bueno when you're staying up til...well more like not sleeping for 2 days straight and let's just leave it at that for now..
    </p>
    <p>
      How do I feel about my values and do I think I can help mediate stereotype threat if you I feel it? Mmm...I want to throw a bunch of oxymorons and paradoxes here, but I'll probably end up confusing myself in the process. I'm someone who enjoys time alone but also enjoys talking to people, but when I'm alone you'll probably catch me lost in thought while I doing some self reflecting. Seriously though, take me to a nice spot where there's a nice breeze and I probably will talk to you for a few minutes before either dozing off or closing my eyes and just thinking about how nice life is at that time and place.
    </p>

      In terms of mediating stereotype threat, I don't have any doubt in my mind that I think I'll attempt to help mediate it when I feel it. The one thing I have concerns about though, would be whether or not what I choose to do seems "right." Sometimes, you just have the right intention, but that doesn't always equate to the right action you know? It's something that I've learned and struggled with from time to time throughout my lifetime; sometimes you truly think you're doing the right thing and helping out, but sometimes it's just not the right or best thing for whatever matter. It's like when you're giving your friend advice when they tell you about a problem, but really, your friend just wants you to listen to their problem and not be told what to do. It's trivial and frustrating at times, but it's important to be able to understand that people are different and that friendships don't necessarily involve agreement, but should involve understanding and acceptance of the things that would normally lead towards unfair judgment.
