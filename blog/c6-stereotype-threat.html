        I won't get into the knitty gritty of what stereotype threat and impostor syndrome are, because I think it'd be quite a feat to not have had some kind of idea of what either are. Even if you haven't experienced either before yourself, there's a chance that you may have imposed one of the two on someone else. 
    </p>
    <p>   
    While the two are similar, they're both very different. While stereotype threat refers to the feeling that one is at risk of having to confirm a negative stereotype about one's own group (be it social, cultural, orientation, etc.), impostor syndrome refers to an individual feeling unworthy of one's own success because they are not fully capable of internalizing their own accomplishments and worth - they credit luck and lies rather than credit themselves. In the case of the latter, an individual is probably familiar with the phrase, "Fake it 'til you make it."
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the negative connotation that may come with the words "stereotype", "threat", "impostor", and "syndrome", experiences with stereotype threat and impostor syndrome can be used to one's advantage. How?
        It's a matter of perception really. In fact, let me just admit now that I'm typically the type of person to see the cup half rather than half empty, and that I'm the kind of guy who'll try to always look for the good in someone or something no matter what's already been said and done. So in my honest opinion, you just have to ask yourself if at the end of the day, are you really going to limit yourself to being only what others see yourself to be?
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, there's nothing wrong with being the kind of person that others make you out to be. Back in my first year of undergrad, we had to attend a school wide presentation on stereotypes. Being Asian American, I wasn't surprised to hear the whole, "You're Asian so you're good at math" bit. But I was surprised to hear about what was said after. It turns out, that in one particular study (the name of the study escaped my mind years ago), that stereotypical comment was actually used as a form of encouragement. Well sort of. In the study, individuals would take a standard math test where, prior to taking the test, they would be told either "You're Asian, so you're good at math," or "You're not Asian, so you're not good at math." After taking the test once, they would take the a similar/near identical test again but without being told anything beforehand. Actually, I think they took the second test first and vice-versa, but yeah. The results showed that the scores were notably higher when individuals were told "You're Asian, so you're good at math," and also lower when told "You're not Asian, so you're not good at math." After hearing that, I admittedly tried hyping myself up before tests by saying, "I'm Asian, so I'm good at this and will do well." Judge me if you want, but heck, I think it worked out pretty well, placebo effect or not.
        </p>
        <p>
        Small jokes aside, I think that one of the most important things we all owe to ourselves is self-acknowledgment. Nothing's wrong with being competitive, and nothing's wrong with being insecure, but it ain't particularly right to beat yourself up all the time. When I mentioned the phrase "Fake it 'til you make it" earlier, I brought it up because I really think that it's a phrase you'll come across a lot in your lifetime. If you've ever suffered from impostor syndrome in the slightest like me, than you probably have a sense of what the phrase implies even if you're only now just hearing it. Ironically, I heard it for the first time while I was telling my former boss that I was giving my 2 weeks to attend a coding bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
        The thing about faking it til you make it is well, it's not necessarily a good thing nor is it necessarily a bad thing. A lot of times, we find ourselves struggling internally when it comes to things like first round nterviews, first dates, etc., all for the sake of making a good first impression. On one hand, you can sell yourself short because you think that in doing so, you're being "honest" about what you can do and being "realistic" when it comes to things you can't do. It's like when you list a skill set on LinkedIn or on your resume, but if you were given a project that required you to use that skill, you'd probably be in some deep s***, so you end up not including that skill anymore to cover yourself.</p>
        <p>
        On the other hand, you can oversell yourself and say things like "Oh yeah, I know about C++, Fourtran, and whatnot," when God knows you have no flipping clue about what the words that just came out of your mouth mean. In this case, you're perfectly aware of what you're really capable of and what you're not, but you'll spout some fancy lingo and jargon to nail that first impression, and work like a dog to live up to those expectations you just set for yourself. Why? Cause you don't want to be "found out" and labeled as a liar, that's why. So you go on about being this and that, and then get the job, and then it happens - you're hit with impostor syndrome. You've been working for X number of months where you're making bank, but you STILL have NO CLUE about how the heck you made it there. Impostor syndrome. 
        <p>
        So does the fact that you're now experiencing impostor syndrome mean that you're actually unaccomplished? No. In fact, it should make you realize what you have accomplished. Cause I mean sure, you may have overexaggerated and rambled on about things you've heard in passing while you were interviewing, there's no denying that there at least some truth on what you said and what you listed on your resume. It's just a matter of what you're focused on. Sometimes, you just need to look back at what you did do and tell yourself, "Man, I'm glad I'm done with that and all those all nighters," in order to remind yourself of the blood, sweat, and tears you put into doing something that mattered and to simply remind yourself that you've accomplished something. 
        </p>

        Going back to that reference about my former boss telling me about "faking it 'til I make it." That day where I gave my 2-weeks notice was life changing. But that day has made me eternally grateful to not only my former team and boss, but to myself as well. I worked at the company straight after graduating for about 8 months. I had talked time and time again about how I wanted to become a front-end developer, and about the things I was learning about on the side. For a while, my learning was a bit consistent, but then I found myself simply talking and not actually developing. When my team would mention a language or concept that I came across in my studies, I would chime in and try to say something witty, but there was always a limit to how much I could say since I really wasn't knowledgable enough about the things they were talking about. I had impostor syndrome for a while, I just never realized that there was a term for what I was feeling. I would talk about how I would finish my week's worth of work early and be more than willing to take on PHP scripting or some design mockup work, but when it came down to the actual scripting and whatnot, I really struggled on my own to figure out what was going on. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I won't deny that I was lucky, because I really was. I was on a team of seasoned developers who had as many years of experience in the industry as I was old. As weird as it may sound, I was lucky that they didn't expect too much from me when it came to coding. That's not to say that they didn't think I was capable, rather, they knew I was capable, but knew it would take time. I was just too caught up in feelings of anxiety and self doubt to realize that they really were okay with the fact that I was the only guppy in the pond.
        </p>
        <p>
        Something that a lot of people like myself don't realize when they're dealing with impostor syndrome, is that people who experience it are typically the type of people who hold themselves to a higher standard and are hardworking. They're the kind of people who want to live up others' expectations and live up to their own expectations, but sometimes have a hard time dealing with a long journey.
        </p>
        <p>
        What I can say though, is that for someone like me, when you realize that you're dealing with something like stereotype threats or impostor syndrome, go on whatever journey is necessary to overcome it. I'm doing just that by attending Dev Bootcamp in order to finally take steps towards becoming a developer, and honestly, I learned more than I did at work within a week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp already. And while you embark on this new journey, keep your supporters and roots in mind, because they'll definitely be your source of strength when things get rough. And at the same time, find new people to join you on your journey, because chances are, they were looking for someone like you, too.
