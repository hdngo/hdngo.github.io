    <p class="thot"><em>Kind of hard to believe that tomorrow's the first day of Phase 1.</em></p> <!--optional-->
    <p>
        Let me start off by saying that I'll be keeping this post rather short, because the more I think about what I want to say here, the further I get lost in my thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week's been a rather interesting one for me. Yesterday marked my first full week in San Francisco and I'll admit that I haven't been the most productive lately. I wanted to tackle Bootstrap and whatnot to redesign my site, but this week being the last week before I go off the radar and all, I wanted to see as many people as I could who <em>just so happened to be visiting this week</em> and go sightseeing. It's hard to quench my thirst for adventure, but I know that I'll be able to make time to go out and explore every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've literally called my Mom and Dad every day since I've been here. They worry a lot, and even though my Dad isn't the most expressive with his emotions, my Mom's the one telling me on the side how he keeps asking about me. Love them both, dearly. Things are really sinking in right now, and it upsets me when I think about how I'll be missing my Mom's birthday next week, but at the end of the day it makes me remember that the goal is to push through Dev Bootcamp, get a job, be happy, and make my parents happy.
    </p> 
    <p>
        I've got a younger sister, too, and I honestly think that the distance is helping us grow closer as siblings. She's kind of in that rebel phase right now, but communication between us has become better. Even though going to DBC is kind of like me going back to college, there's a pretty noticeable difference in how we talk together now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, my site redesign. The first version of my site was sneaker inspired, and although I really like Air Max's, I changed things up. I wanted to keep a clean, minimalist design that could be more easily made into a responsive site later on, and to also experiment with my adventurous state of mind. Hence the photos you'll see here and there. I also really like rust orange right now. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But yeah, as corny as it may sound, I really want to say that the site design I have now reflects my state of mind and has a bit of my soul embedded in it. I think it reflects curiosity, adventure, and a whole lot more. For now, the biggest adventure is going through Dev Bootcamp and becoming a web developer / programmer / whatever you want to call it. And it won't end with me getting a job because that's not the end goal. The end goal is simply being able to go home to my family to tell them, "I made it," and celebrate them for allowing me to see what I'm capable of. On that note, I want to repost this song because it's just full of good vibes.
