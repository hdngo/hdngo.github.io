        Before we start, I gotta admit: 1) the method is actually <strong>map</strong> and not maps, and 2) I don't know why its called map instead of something else like transform or change. I guess you could say that with the Enumerable#map method, you're essentially "mapping out directions." End of bad joke.
    </p>
    <p>
        But really, let's actually try to stretch out this map analogy a little bit shall we? When you're Googling for directions to some place, you're basically asking, "What steps do I take to get from A to B?" With the Enumerable#map method, you're basically acting as Google Maps here by providing your program with steps to get from A (you're receiver object) to B (your output). I think I'm trying too hard with this map analogy, so I'm gonna stop.
    <p>
        Anyways, take a look at this example below:
    </p> 
    <img style="text-align:center" src="./imgs/map-snippet.png" alt="map example"/>
    <p>
      In the example, the code is essentially saying, "do this to the current element." So by having "i*i" in the block, we're saying, multiply the current element by itself. The good thing about map, is that we actually end up returning a new array (yeeee for non-destructive!). The map method also allows you to "replace" the elements of a string in a sense, too, in that you could have done something like replace "i*i" with "no longer an integer," which would have returned an array with strings equal to "no longer an integer." 
      </p>
      <p>
      It gets kind of tricky, but don't over think it, just know that if you think out of the box a bit, you can actually make great use out of the map method. In the words of Albert Einstein:
    </p>

      <p>
      <em>Logic will get you from A to B. Imaginationg will take you everywhere.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Well, with coding, you kind of need both, but hopefully you get the point.
