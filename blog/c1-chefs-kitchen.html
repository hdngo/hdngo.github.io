  <h1>Into Hell's Kitchen?</h1>
  <h2>I swear, I'm going to be hungry by the time I finish this post.</h2>

      Man, even though Shereef didn't necessarily talk about food, just hearing kitchen has got me thinking about all those Food Network shows and whatnot, so I'm going to write this with the goal of answering the questions concisely and grabbing something to eat as soon as possible. Shereef just mentioned cereal in the Fireside Chat video. Cereal sounds good...

        Besides the painful experience I'm going through now as I write this here blog post while hearing the words "kitchen", "restaurant", "stew", "cereal" uttered in the video, I have to say that my impression of DBC has only gotten better having watched the video. Shereef's kitchen analogy was seriously on point. Without a doubt, I definitely had a partial 'restaurant mindset' as I applied and thought about applying to coding bootcamps, but now I can say I'm definitely cultivating that growth and kitchen mindset I have as I make my way through Phase 0 and anxiously await Phase 1 and so on. I won't deny that I'm a bit nervous, but I'm too thrilled about the thought of all the possibilities that await me once things really get moving after Phase 0 to worry right now.

        To be completely honest, I want to be onsite as soon as possible, but when I think about it and calm my nerves, I realize that I'm better off the way I am right now. I'm hungry, that's for sure, but I'm also being impatient. Hearing Shereef's thoughts on how he thinks the prep phase is actually short really struck a chord with me. He makes a valid point, one that addresses the concern about varying level of experiences at DBC, saying how this 9-week prep phase is DBC's notion of having a long term prep to allow people to scale up so they can come in and be ready to jam with the rest of the bootcampers. For those who already been swimming in the deep end of development, it's really just another opportunity to get a quick refresher on some material and well, if it's easy, they'll have time to spare and be able to work on other things in the process. For those like me with little to no experience, this is our time to practice swimming without our floatees and get ready to move on to jumping off the diving board and swimming in the deep end. I'm a bad swimmer in life though, by the way, but I'm in that Johnny Tsunami state of mind right now and I'm ready to ride whatever waves come my way. Seriously though, I'm hyped for what lies in store. But oh, I can't surf either. Time to get some food. Seriously, writing this blog post reminds me of when I had to read an SAT prompt about sleeping, no bueno.
