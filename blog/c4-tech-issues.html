        On April 28th, 2015, Lauren Voswinkel announced:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>"On May 1st, International Workers’ Day, I will be publicly discussing my job title, my experience and my salary on #talkpay and I urge everyone to do so as well."</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Pay inequality has always been a hot topic for discussion, but man, if you haven't seen all the Tweets with that've been hashtagged with #talkpay lately, then you're in for a surprise. The movement is crazy, and rightfully so if I do say so myself. Why? Because who wouldn't want to be treated equally amirite?
    </p> 
    <p>
        I won't get into the whole nitty gritty of the movement and whatnot, but you should definitely check out Lauren's post <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/news/lets-talk-about-pay">here</a> and then go check out the Tweets that ensued after.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a student with a load full of loans who has taken out yet another loan in order to attend Dev Bootcamp, there's no point in denying that I don't care about how much I'll get paid at my next job. Will I be stingy or have some sort of minimum threshold? Maybe, probably. Does it help that I'm a minority? Nope. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Pulling the figures from Lauren's post real quick,  statistics show that African American and Latino women make $0.64 and $0.53 respectively in comparison to white men's $1.00. That's a lot. Don't think so? If you're someone who thinks a 10-20 cent increase in gas prices is ridiculous, you'll probably want to go and look at the numbers again. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crazy thing is, discrepancies exist in the work force in many levels. Differences in salary are just 1 part of the equation, or should I say inequality? Lately, there's been more social experiments that have tested hiring rates across the board. One involved <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/02/jose-joe-job-discrimination_n_5753880.html">José Zamora</a>, who in his experiment became Joe Zamora, by dropping off merely a single letter from his name. The results: his inbox went from being empty to full in a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard to ignore cases like these when you're someone who is either in or entering the tech industry, and even if you're not, you still shouldn't ignore it. Seriously, as an individual, you gotta know your worth. If you're able to perform at the same level as someone else, or even better for that matter, don't you think you deserve to at least be paid the same amount? Seriously though, how long can you go on being ignorant of the fact that you've been cheated for who knows how long.

      A lot of people that say we should treat eachother equally and that the things that make us different are the things that make us unique. But where's the value in being unique when our "value" can be deemed lesser by those very things that make you unique?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh and a bit more about me. I left my first full time job after graduating where my annual salary was $65k. My friends who went to the same school as me who studied Computer Science have gotten average offers of $80-100k. So am I pursuing web development to make more money? 
    </p>
    <p style=text-align:center>
      No.
      </p>
      <p>I simply have a genuine passion and interest for web development. And as long as I have enough money to support my parents and my younger sister, and not die underneath the pressure of student loans, I'll be happy. On the other hand, my mom said, "You left a good paying job to go to camp, so you better make over $100k." Moms...
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. Thanks for reading my post! For me, I actually felt like I was more blunt and well, outright and way more opinionated than ever in writing something like this, so even if you've judged me in a bad light for this, I still thank you for reading about what I had to say regarding the topic.
