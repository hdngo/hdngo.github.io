        Hello hello! For today's technical blog, I'm going to be making my best attempt to answer the question: "What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?" Personally, I'll admit that it's probably one of the easier questions to answer for this challenge, but I'm challenging myself at the same time to keep my answer clear, concise, and condensed. Furthermore, I'm gonna try to explain things <strong>without any pictures</strong> to see if I can get my point across with just words! Here goes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For starters, let's compare creating an HTML element and applying margins, borders, padding, and all that jazz to wrapping a gift shall we? With HTML and CSS, the HTML element you're styling is essentially your gift, Christmas present, whatever. You can choose to be lazy and not wrap it, and just say, "Here ya go," or take the time to wrap it up and make it look nice. Now I'm not saying that NOT applying padding and borders to your HTML element means it'll end up looking ugly, but bear with me for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Padding. It's CSS's version of bubble wrap. Before you put your gift in a box, you gotta consider if you want to add any kind of protective layer so your gift isn't bouncing around hitting the edges of the box and whatnot. Padding's completely optional, but it's nice to from time to time.
    </p> 
    <p>
        So if padding is bubble wrap, that makes the giftbox your border. Thing is, you can stylize the box, and on top of that, you don't have to actually use a box. With CSS, you can set the style of your border to be dashed, solid, double-lined, etc. So perhaps the best way to conceptualize that is to think of your border really as your box being "stylized" with whatever kind of giftwrap you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, you have your margins. Well, this may not exactly go with the whole box-model idea, but in a nutshell, margins refer to the space around your HTML element between the outermost edges (the border) and the next element. So, keeping the Christmas present analogy in mind, it's like saying, put the presents side by side under the Christmas tree, or apply some margins (a.k.a. space) between them. Again, optional, and it all comes down to preference really.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welp, that's it for my explanation, hope it made sense to you! Now if you'd be so kind, please teach me how to actually wrap presents so that they look nice!
