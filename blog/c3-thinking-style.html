        ART. A.R.T. Abstract Random Thinker. Apparently that's my Gregorc Thinking Style according to the quiz <a id="zeros" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a>. "Thinkers who organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments." Sounds like me, but to be honest, I think that my thinking style depends on my mood and the situation I'm in really. Why? Cause I like to experiment, be realistic at times, and try to partake in the world of theory before my brain explodes from overthinking. Maybe not so much the latter. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To be completely honest, I gladly admit that I'm happy I ended up being categorized as an abstract random thinker though. Why? Because the other ones just sound so...rigid. Concrete. Sequential. Bleh. I like to have some kind of flow and order going on here and there, but I'm not a neat freak nor am I someone who likes going through each day of the week with the same old routine. It gets boring. Am I essentially acknowledging that I can be a bit unorganized and messy? Sure, why not? 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        <em>I can find order in chaos.</em>
    </p> 

    <p>
      I take joy in breaking out of the mold and venturing outside of my comfort zone, and I learn more when I'm forced to adapt to things. I enjoy meeting new people and being that 1 friend you can count on to ask a stranger for directions when you're lost. I'm a people person, that's what the definition of an abstract random thinker entails in my opinion. That's not to say that people with other thinking styles aren't people people though. And despite how much I agree with being the definition of an abstract random thinker according to this  <a id="zeros" href="http://homepages.ius.edu/dschwei2/s505s486/test2types.htm">link</a>, I'd still consider myself quite the introvert, because I like to have some nice quiet downtime for myself without having to worry about anyone else from time to time. The fact that I'm comfortable with that makes me feel more confident about Phase 0 actually, because I know that once the On-Site session starts, I'll essentially be a "stranger" to my family and friends back home as I hustle and grind, burning that midnight oil throughout Phases 1-3 on the other side of the country haha.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, I honestly think that Phase 0 has been very good to me. The only thing that I think I'm struggling with is my sleep schedule to be honest, because well I'm kind living that college lifestyle right now. But on a more serious note, I'd have to say that matching my partner's energy level and considering how I make suggestions while working together are two things I'm very conscious of. I'm quick to adapt once I've met someone and learned more about them, but first impressions are dealbreakers for some ya know?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
      <em>But right now, I'm taking chances.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that my thinking style allows me to be comfortable being vulnerable and okay with being judged, because in the end, I'm happy with who I am, and I care about those who care about me, and would be fine living my life with just those people in it. I don't believe in dragging out conflicts, because I think people should just be honest and not try to beat around the bush. It's childish ya know? Just be careful with words. Give me a chance, and I'll prove myself to be a valuable partner. If I fail at something, let me know and I'll work harder at it, and I'll be sure to prove myself to you and myself later. But I'll also thank you for giving me the push, cause that's what we'll all need while we're at DBC right? Don't take me too seriously and literally, because deepdown I'd like to be as laidback as possible when we can, though I won't necessarily mind grinding through some nights in order to extend my weekend hours haha.
