      <h3>An Introduction to the Internet</h3>

        Something that I know I'll need to remember in the midst of learning how to program and develop websites is how the Internet works. I mean let's be honest, can you really give me a flawless explanation as to how everything works if I asked you to right now? If you can, good for you, if you can't, no worries, becauseI'm going to just give cover the basics as basic as I can. And don't worry, I'll be working on this particular blog incrementally so that I can simplify it as much as possible. 
    </p>
    <p>

<h3>The Internet is like a wire.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Servers are connected to the Internet; the Internet is a super computer</li>
<li>Web pages are on a server's hard drive</li>
<li>Every server has an Internet protocol address</li>
<li>Because IP address names are hard to remember, we give them names</li>
<li>Our own computers are not servers,  b/c they’re not directly connected to the Internet</li>
<li>Our computers are clients, as they’re connected by an 
Internet service provider (ISP)</li>
<li>Whenever an email, picture, etc. is sent across the Internet, it's broken into packets which are later put back together</li>
</ul>

<h3>IP Addresses and Routers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everything corrected to the Internet has an IP address, even phones</li>
<li>routers direct your packets around the Internet</li>
<li>Packets are wrapped in "layers"</li>
<li>The 1st layer is the IP address, it's sent to the next router and adds that IP address; each router adds another layer/IP address</li>
<li>when the server sends back info, it sends back packets with identical wrapping, each router unwraps the layer</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Internet vs The Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Internet is a system of interconnected computer networks using the same rules (protocols) to talk to each other</li>
<li>It was initially used for exchanging, emails and remote logins</li>
<li>It's the ‘network of networks'</li>
<li>The Web is an application built on top of the Internet</li>
<li>It's an information sharing app that allows you to read and interact with web pages through a web browser</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web Browser</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop software applications allowing you to browse the Internet
to look at a website without a browser</li>
<li>Web browsers take code and represent it</li>
<li>World Wide Web Consoritum (W3C) sets forth browser guidelines but can’t enforce them</li>
<li>One big problem is backwards browser compliance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web Servers</h3>
<ul>
<li>A computer that can be accessed through the Internet</li>
<li>Web servers receive your requests for web pages and put together the parts, then send it back</li>
<li>Windows comes with Internet Information Services (IIS) and Apple computers come with Apache - web server softwares</li>
</ul>

<h3>Websites vs Web Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Websites are static in that they're not updated all that often</li>
<li>Web applications are dynamic and ever changing</li>
<li>They rely on you to interact with them</li>
<li>They're built with HTML, CSS, etc, but also use programming languages like PHP, Ruby, Python and frameworks like Rails, Django and CakePHP</li>
<li>They almost always use databases - therefore they’re dynamic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Domains</h3>
<ul>
<li>A domain name is a shortcut to a computer hooked up to the Internet</li>
<li>Top level domains are .com, .net, .org, etc.<li>
<li>Second level domains: site name ie. skill crush.com</li>
<li>Domain names are the nicknames for IP addresses</li>
<li>ICANN - the Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers controls the ins and outs of naming on the Internet, and are responsible for licensing everyone who sells domains</li>
</ul>

<h3>DNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The phone book of the Internet</li>
<li>Domain Name System</li>
<li>DNS servers are computers that keep record of domain names and IP addresses</li>
<li>When you make a web request, your computer asks the DNS server for the IP address
numbers get into the DNS phone book when you register a domain name</li>
<li>When you change a domain name or web server, DNS can take time to update - propagation delay</li>
</ul>

<h3>IP Address</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your computer’s address on the Internet</li>
<li>Each number in your IP address: X.X.X.X can go from 0 to 255</li>
<li>IPv6 IP addresses are super long</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction to DNS and Creating a New Website</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy the domain name</li>
<li>Registrars get licenses to sell domain names</li>
<li>Find a host for the website - if you buy domain and hosting service from the same company, you don’t need to worry about DNS</li>
<li>Specify name servers for your domain</li>
<li>Point the domain name at the IP address (using the registrar, host or another)
point domain.com to your new IP address</li>
<li>www is the host name, IP given by your host</li>
<li>Using * as a hostname -> everything.domain.com points to the IP address</li>
<li>@ as the hostname —> domain.com without the www part</li>
</ul>
