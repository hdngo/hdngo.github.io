        Sup! Welcome to my Tech blog, I'll be posting who knows what for now as I make my way through Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0. I'll also be trying to blog on my tumblr @bientu, so feel free to check out my posts there too!

        Today's post is about Git and GitHub if you didn't git the hint earlier - puns stopping now, don't worry. So! Version control. It's great stuff, and I'd have a hard time believing you if you thought otherwise because version control is something everyone wishes they had at some point. Examples of when? Mmm, well think about those times you were playing a video game and well, died, and had to start way back from the beginning because you didn't make it to the checkpoint. Or that other time when you were working on a homework assignment in Microsoft Word, and suddenly your laptop crashes or your battery dies, and there goes X hours of work if you weren't too busy scrolling through Facebook. Hopefully, Word managed to make recover your file though, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those checkpoints and recovery files are your ticket to understanding the benefits of version control. They're save states, more or less. Now let's put ourselves in a scenario where we're coding for some project. You're going to be making changes along the way, and end up (or should be) making changes to refactor (simplify) your code. While trying to refactor things, you end up screwing things up and nothing works anymore. That's where version control can help. With version control, you can essentially save the current state of your work by making what Git refers to as a 'commit'. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        By making a commit, you're making use of Git's ability to keep track of your changes. Git literally has a tracked and untracked state for your files - untracked being files that were added since your last commit. But let's take a quick step back yeah? Commits, checkpoints, recovery state. I won't make any assumptions about what you know, so just know that when it comes to version control and Git, your commits create saved states that can be accessed and reverted to. By that, I mean to say that if you end up commiting a change but then go, "Crap, I actually didn't want that," you can use a certain command to tell your computer to undo what you just did. I won't list that command, because for now it'll be easier to just listen to what I have to say next. When you've made a change and are ready to save, you can run 'git status' to see what changes have been made since your last commit. From there, you can choose to run 'git add filename' to include changed files in your new save state, or 'git checkout filename' to remove them. When you're ready, go ahead and run 'git commit -m' or 'git commit -v' to say, "Okay, save this the way I have it setup." The '-m' and '-v' are options that'll let you enter a brief comment to basically enter a short description of what changes you made. That way, you're not guessing and checking as much.

        Now, GitHub. Yeah, unfortunately, it's not the same thing as Git. Are they completely different? Well not really. Git's basically software that's on your computer that allows you to use version control, and GitHub's like the online counterpart. GitHub allows you to store your code and work online; you can access your work online or even allow other people to work on your code - the more the merrier right? The other great thing about GitHub, is that despite its ability to allow multiple people to work on the same thing, you don't have to worry too much about the original file being messed up. Collaborators can copy files and work on separate branches (think parallel universe) that won't cause any changes in the original files until the master branch is merged with it to include the changes. Just know that in order to get Git working with GitHub, you first need to establish a remote - a connection more or less - from your computer to an online hub, hence GitHub. It's simple to do, so you can definitely figure that out on your own with some Googling haha.
