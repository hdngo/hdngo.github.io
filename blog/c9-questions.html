        Something that I think that a lot of people secretly struggle with, is gathering up the courage to ask a question when they're confused. Why? Because sometimes you're just worried about embarrassing yourself by essentially admitting to those around you that you don't quite get what's going on.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, a lot of us have been in situations where we've sat through say, an hour long presentation and have come to the point where the presenter asks, "Any questions?" After sitting restlessly in a chair for what seems like forever, having anxiously waited for some kind of alarm to go off to signify that the day is over and it's time to go home, we're caught off guard and are surprised when someone daringly raises their hand to ask a question. And that's when all of the eyes in the room shift focus to that one person who is preventing everyone else in the room from going home, and thoughts like "Why? Ugh, seriously? Dang it..." are present in the room. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That was kind of dramatic, but it does happen. People simply have different priorities and sometimes, they'd rather not stick around to hear your question if it doesn't pertain to them.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Anyways, that's not what this post is meant for. What we're concerned about is how to ask good questions, yeah?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, I think that there's a lot of things that CAN be taken into consideration when it comes down to asking the right question, so I'm only going to say a few things that I think are important here. Forgive me if I come off as a bit blunt here and there, but recently, I think that being blunt is simply the best way to get the message across in some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't be wishy-washy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a question, ask. One of the worst things you can do to yourself is to take away from your own learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be afraid to ask questions, don't be afraid of "holding people back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember the first point. Don't take away from your own learning experience. By asking questions, you're helping yourself, but you're also helping others solidify their understanding of what you're trying to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you ask a question, try to answer it yourself first, or Google for the answer yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's something that's stressed a lot in the work place, but there's a valid reason behind it. Sometimes people simply can't afford to spend their time walking you through things that you're expected to already know or through things that they invested a lot of their own time in learning. If you can save others some time by finding the answer to your question yourself, you've done both parties some good.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you find the answer, take pride in the fact that you found it, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that a lot of times, people simply don't give themselves enough credit for what they've accomplished. Asking questions and finding answers is some tricky business. But you'll be amazed at how much of an impact word choice and grammar can have on your research process. And well, the fact that you got an answer - whether you found it yourself or got it from someone else - means that you've learned something. But you know, getting the answer from someone else means you basically managed to subconsciously do some of the things I mentioned earlier, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I've mentioned word choice and grammar, but there's definitely a lot of things to consider when you're putting a question together. But in my honest opinion, it doesn't really get any easier than "be clear and concise." Granted, being clear and concise can still require a reasonable amount of details and specifics, but you want to try and keep your question as short as possible. No one really wants to read through paragraphs on end to figure out what it is you're trying to ask. Going off that, no one wants to spend time raising their brows, scratching their heads trying to figure out what it is you asked when you've poorly posed your question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, there's just a lot of things to be careful of when asking a question and asking it correctly. But you shouldn't worry so much about those things that you end up not asking the question at all in one way or another. Keep in mind that everyone started somewhere and had to ask questions and go about finding answers to learn what they know now. And most importantly, give credit and thanks to the people that help you arrive at the answer you're searching for. Because chances are, you'll probably ask them something else tomorrow.
