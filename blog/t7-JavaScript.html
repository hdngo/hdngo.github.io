      What to say about JavaScript..it ain't no Ruby, that's for sure. That doesn't mean it isn't a fun language to dabble in, but I think I'm starting to understand why I kept seeing the other books I've read on Ruby mention "syntactic sugar."
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is very interesting though. At least, I have to keep telling myself that for now if I want to follow the route I'm currently considering taking towards a front-end web developer less something down the road enlightens me on another route.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the interesting things (in my current opinion) about JavaScript is that creating an object is almost identical to creating a hash in Ruby when using colon (:) notation. It's kind of weird, but you basically have the whole "var objectname = {}" with what JavaScript refers to as "properties" and "values." Basically like keys and values in Ruby, yeah? 
    </p> 
    <p>
      In terms of referencing properties of an object in JavaScript, we can almost draw a parallel to Ruby's classes and their use of attribute methods for instance variables. Rather than use bracket notation (hash[key]) like we do in Ruby, we can simply run "object.propertyname" to retrieve an object's property's value in JavaScript. Neat right? And to throw it out there for now, I think you can still use bracket notation to get a property's value, I've done it before actually but am not 100% sure if it always works, so I'll definitely be coming back to this post later to post my findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there's a lot of things that can be compared and contrasted when it comes to Ruby and JavaScript, I'm actually going to put a pause on this post for now since I should probably figure out how to condense my thoughts. But for now I'll just braindump a little knowledge so both you and me can retain a little something something. Rather than methods, JavaScript uses functions, basically where you store operations and whatnot. Scope chains in JavaScript work in a similar fashion as they do in Ruby, super important to know right now, though it's a topic definitely worth looking into some more. In terms of built-in methods/functions, there are actually some crossovers between the two languages, but Ruby still seems to take the cake in terms of intuitiveness. I could list out the reasons why I think so, but from my experience so far, it's definitely something you have to feel out by dabbling with JavaScript yourself. I say that because, it's like when you think you got the gist of things so you feel all good about yourself, but then you're thrown a curveball and tried to swing like you normally do and see the ball fly right past you, and all you can say is, "Wait..what?"
