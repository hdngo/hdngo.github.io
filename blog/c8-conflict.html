1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?

    <p>
        Having thought about it, I can understand why some people say that sometimes, your worst enemy is yourself. In my case, I've more or less been told by my best friends that I'm more selfless than selfish; always going the extra mile for people other than myself (unnecessarily so, they've added). In fact, it didn't really occur to me just how large a problem I had created for myself by shouldering the problems of others until I had asked one of my best friends what their first impression of me was.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I thought you were a great guy, but it didn't seem like you really had your own opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought about that, and of course I asked what she meant by that, and here's what I had come to realize:
    </p> 
    <p>
    I don't mind helping others, I really do live for other people, and part of that mentality comes from my life experiences, my religion, my upbringing, and so forth. I do have my own opinions, but I often try to please as many people as I can by trying to compromise as much as possible, unnecessarily. If you asked me to tell you about the times where I did something selfishly, I could probably only give you 1 or 2 examples at best off the top of my head.
    </p>
    <p>
    Out of those 2 examples, one of them actually is related to Dev Bootcamp. Yup. My decision to go to Dev Bootcamp is, for me, probably the most selfish decision I've ever made in my life to date, and it's one that I don't regret at all. That's not to say that making the decision to go through with DBC didn't cause me any problems along the way, though.
    </p>
    <p>
    Breaking the news to my parents wasn't the easiest thing, but it wasn't the hardest thing either. Convincing my parents that I had decided to move out to California primarily for pursuing a career change was. See, I had come out of my first relationship roughly 6-7 months beforehand. Keywords for my parents: "first relationship," keywords for me: "6-7 months." 
    </p>
    <p>
    I'll spare you on all the details, but long story short, my parents thought that my main reason for wanting to go to California was to chase after the girl I had my first relationship with. On the other hand, I was trying to convince them the whole time that I was solely considering San Francisco because that's where a friend of mine was living and he had offered me a place to stay if I got accepted into any of the boot camps out there. You can probably imagine how that conversation kinda went.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would say that it wasn't wrong for my parents to have the thoughts that they did, because really, they were just worried about me and didn't want me making any decisions I'd later on regret. For some reason though, even though I knew they would probably mention my ex, there was something about the way my dad brought her up in the middle of the conversation that made me angry and upset. But that's not what blew my fuse, it was something that was said towards the end of the conversation where I kind of lost it and decided to go back to my apartment and call it a day because things weren't going well and sometimes it's better to not sit around and beat a dead horse. I won't say what was said, but it was something that came off rude enough to put me at a loss for words and storm off more or less.
    </p>
    <p>
    Halfway down the road back to my apartment, it's needless to say that I had my thoughts all messed up. I didn't know what I was going to do anymore, but I knew that I wasn't happy with where I was at my work - but I couldn't bring myself to quitting work if my parents weren't happy with me (do ya kinda see or have a feel for my problem here?). 
    </p>
    <p>
    I ended up turning around and going back home. I let go of whatever pride I had because in the end, I reminded myself that my parents were just being parents. I mean, I can only imagine how hard it is for parents to deal with their children and their relationships, that's why they're so overprotective sometimes. I'll leave it at that because, well I would end up writing about how grateful I am to my parents for days otherwise. And the conversation that took place afterwards, as in after I made it back to my parent's house, ended up lasting for another 3 hours. So yeah, it was a rough and busy weekend for me, and it was the same weekend I came back from my California trip, too.
    </p>
    <p>
    Looking back, I really just wish that I had been able to keep my cool the way I had originally planned to when I thought about how I'd tell my parents and how I imagined the conversation going. But then I realize I'm human and that sometimes, your heart and mind aren't in the same place sometimes and that's how life seems to work. And besides, would you really want to read more than you've already read so far? I just gave you the TDLR of a 5-6 hour conversation, believe it or not. But hey, if you want to hear more about my story or stories for that matter, hit me up and let's grab a bite to eat or get something to drink ya?
    </p>
    <p>
    So what did I learn after all of that driving back and forth and breaking the news to my family and friends that weekend? A sh*t ton. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I learned that I have an amazing family and some really supportive friends. But I also learned that being family and being friends doesn't mean you always agree on the same thing. And that the family and friends who speak their mind to you even when their can be some friction involved are your real family and friends, not the ones who just nod, say "Mmhm, yeah, ok, yeah man," all the time. I learned that everyone was actually more relieved than I was, because for once they saw me doing something solely for myself and as funny as it is, they were probably more proud of me than I was of myself.
    </p> 
    <p>
    It's these kinda things that make me realize that I'm a lot luckier than I think I am.
