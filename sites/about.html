        Welp, since it seems like you were curious enough to find out more about me, allow me to introduce myself properly! The name's Harvey Ngo, you can worry about pronouncing my name once you've hired me yeah? Just kidding, or am I?
    </p>

    <p>
        Jordan year's old and recent college grad from the University of Virginia, I left my first full-time -and well paying job to boot - at Booz Allen after 8 months in order to take full control of my career by applying to Dev Bootcamp in order to do more than get my feet wet in web development. I'm going full Johnny Tsunami and Michelangelo (TMNT anyone?), cannonballing into the deep end so I can ramp myself up to build a career in web development. I also want to on photography and design while I'm at it, because I've definitely developed a passion for both, and for me, that'll (hopefully) a lot of traveling in the near future. In the meantime, you'll either find me training to be a developer or roaming off somewhere or dancing. Dancing is my means for expressing myself, I can't simply write about what it does for me cause that doesn't do it any justice. With development and dancing, there's no denying of the beauty in being able to exchange knowledge and experience with someone else, and the in-person experience is much different than a remote one. I'm into old school forms of communication if you didn't get the hint, you know, phone calls, letters, notes, face-to-face.

        So by all means! Hit me up, I insist. Whether it's to grab a cup of coffee even though I don't really drink it, since it just seems like one of those things to do when you're meeting or catching up with someone, or to just make a new friend and hang out! If you're asking me to come along on an adventure to go hiking or explore and take photos, you can already count me in. And if you want to dance/learn how, count me in, too. I purposely left out my style of dance and I'm throwing that fact in your face right now, cause I'm hoping you'll hit me up to ask me more about it. It's also a freebie in terms of a conversation starter - you're welcome.
